# Delivery Workflow

Use this owner after work has been accepted or implemented and needs closure.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the accepted scope and delivery target.
2. Clean only approved or owned local artifacts; preserve unrelated user edits.
3. Run agreed validation commands and acceptance checks.
4. Record failures, skipped checks, and residual risk honestly.
5. If a PR was created or updated, check remote PR state after push: mergeability, CI/check runs, conflicts, and branch protection blockers.
6. Resolve actionable PR blockers in scope, rerun relevant validation, and push updates; stop only for user decisions, credentials, permissions, reviewer action, protected-branch overrides, or external outages.
7. Produce release notes, handoff, or environment cleanup notes as requested.
8. Use `effective-interact` for material handoffs with changes, evidence, validation, cleanup, PR status, and next actions.

## Helper Atoms

- Use `internal-comms` for accepted internal announcements, status updates, incident follow-ups, or FAQs.
- Use `doc-coauthoring` for final PRDs, decision records, or handoff docs that need reader testing.
- Use `theme-factory` only when a delivered artifact needs a final visual theme pass.

## Boundaries

- Do not start new feature work.
- Do not hide failed or skipped verification.
- Do not push, publish, merge, post, or mutate third-party resources unless the user explicitly asks; PR status checks are read-only, while PR updates require the user's requested delivery scope.
- Do not merge a pull request unless the user explicitly asks for that remote mutation.
- Use lock-backed ownership for Harness Hub managed cleanup.
- Follow `workflow-router/references/orchestration-policy.md` for any subagent verification or advisory hook checks; the main agent owns the final handoff.
