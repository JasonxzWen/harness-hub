# State Handoff

After classification, hand off with this compact structure.

```text
STATE: <question | sdd-change | diagnosis | review | delivery | skill-hub-maintenance | clarify | none>
CONFIDENCE: <high | medium | low>
REASON: <one sentence grounded in the user request>
OWNER: <skill name or none>
NEXT GATE: <first gate the owner must satisfy>
HELPERS: <optional helper skills>
EFFECTIVE_INTERACT: <required | default-consider | not-needed>
```

| review | Gather review evidence and report findings first. |
| delivery | Verify acceptance and residual risks before declaring done. |
| skill-hub-maintenance | Gather source, capability, and lifecycle evidence before changing Skill Hub. |
| clarify | Ask one concise question. |
